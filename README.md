# Pizza Hut Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

Pizza Hut, the first international pizza brand to enter Vietnam in 2006, has successfully established itself as the market leader in both revenue and the number of stores, with a total of 130 outlets. The company has consistently targeted young, dynamic customers and adapted to the evolving landscape of the F&B industry, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic (2019-2023). To maintain its leading position, Pizza Hut has implemented several innovative campaigns to align with the changing consumer behavior, which now emphasizes not only product quality but also unique culinary experiences.

### Project Objectives

As a Business Analyst at Pizza Hut, your primary objectives for this project are as follows:

1. **Customer Portrait and Behavioral Insights**: Develop a detailed profile of Pizza Hutâ€™s customers and provide insights into their behavior.
2. **Customer Segmentation Using RFM Model**: Utilize the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to segment customers into distinct groups.
3. **Customer Behavior Prediction Analysis**: Perform predictive analysis on customer behavior for the next six months.
4. **Recommendations for Customer Engagement**: Offer actionable recommendations to enhance customer engagement based on the analysis.

### Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive Customer Segmentation Analysis for Pizza Hut using the RFM model. Customer segmentation, driven by RFM analysis, is a behavior-based approach that groups customers based on their previous purchase transactions.
